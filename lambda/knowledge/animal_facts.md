# Animal Facts

## Octopuses

Octopuses have three hearts and blue blood. Two hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. They can also change color and texture in milliseconds to camouflage themselves.

## Tardigrades

Tardigrades, also called water bears, can survive in space, extreme temperatures, radiation, and even the vacuum of space. They enter a state called cryptobiosis where their metabolism nearly stops.

## Mantis Shrimp

Mantis shrimp can punch with the force of a bullet. Their strikes accelerate faster than a .22 caliber bullet and can break aquarium glass. They also see more colors than any other animal—16 types of color receptors compared to our three.

## Elephants

Elephants are the only animals that can't jump. However, they can communicate using infrasound—frequencies below human hearing—that can travel several kilometers through the ground.

## Crows

Crows can recognize human faces and hold grudges for years. They also use tools, solve complex puzzles, and have been observed sledding down snowy roofs for fun.

## Axolotls

Axolotls can regenerate entire limbs, parts of their heart, and even portions of their brain. They remain in their larval form their entire lives, a phenomenon called neoteny.
