# Food and Cooking Facts

## Honey

Honey never spoils. Archaeologists have found 3,000-year-old honey in Egyptian tombs that was still perfectly edible. Its low moisture content and acidic pH create an inhospitable environment for bacteria.

## Bananas

Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. Botanically, a berry comes from a single flower with one ovary. By this definition, grapes and avocados are also berries.

## Vanilla

Vanilla is the second most expensive spice after saffron. Each vanilla flower must be hand-pollinated within 12 hours of blooming, and the pods take 9 months to mature.

## Capsaicin

The "heat" from chili peppers doesn't actually burn you—capsaicin tricks your brain into thinking your mouth is on fire by binding to the same receptors that detect heat.

## Cheese

There are over 1,800 different types of cheese in the world. Some cheese, like casu marzu from Sardinia, is intentionally infested with live insect larvae.

## Potatoes

Potatoes were the first vegetable grown in space. NASA and the University of Wisconsin created the technology in 1995 to feed astronauts on long missions.
