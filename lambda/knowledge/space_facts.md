# Space Facts

## The Sun

The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in our solar system. It's so large that about 1.3 million Earths could fit inside it. The light from the Sun takes approximately 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth.

## Black Holes

Black holes aren't actually holes—they're incredibly dense objects with gravity so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape once past the event horizon. The nearest known black hole to Earth is about 1,500 light-years away.

## The Moon

The Moon is slowly drifting away from Earth at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters per year. In about 600 million years, it will be too far away to produce total solar eclipses.

## Neutron Stars

A teaspoon of neutron star material would weigh about 6 billion tons on Earth. These stellar remnants spin incredibly fast—some rotate hundreds of times per second.

## Venus

Venus rotates backwards compared to most planets, meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. A day on Venus is longer than its year—it takes 243 Earth days to rotate once but only 225 days to orbit the Sun.
