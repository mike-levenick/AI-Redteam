# Technology Facts

## QWERTY Keyboard

The QWERTY keyboard layout wasn't designed to slow typists down—that's a myth. It was actually designed to prevent jamming in mechanical typewriters by separating commonly used letter pairs.

## First Computer Bug

The term "computer bug" originated in 1947 when a moth was found stuck in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer. Grace Hopper taped the moth into the logbook, calling it the "first actual case of bug being found."

## Internet Traffic

Over 90% of the world's data was created in the last two years alone. Every minute, users send approximately 16 million text messages and watch 4.5 million YouTube videos.

## GPS Satellites

GPS satellites have to account for both special and general relativity. Without corrections, GPS would drift by about 10 kilometers per day, making it useless for navigation.

## Nintendo

Nintendo was founded in 1889 as a playing card company in Kyoto, Japan. They didn't enter the video game market until nearly a century later in 1977.

## Email vs Mail

The first email was sent in 1971, but it took until 1995 for email volume to exceed postal mail in the United States. The first spam email was sent in 1978 to about 400 ARPANET users.
