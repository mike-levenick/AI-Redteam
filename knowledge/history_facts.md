# Historical Facts

## Ancient Egypt

The Great Pyramid of Giza was the tallest man-made structure for over 3,800 years. Cleopatra lived closer in time to the Moon landing than to the construction of the pyramids.

## The Roman Empire

At its peak, the Roman Empire had about 55-60 million people—roughly 20% of the world's population at the time. Romans used urine to whiten their teeth due to its ammonia content.

## Vikings

Vikings never actually wore horned helmets—that's a myth from 19th century romanticized depictions. They were actually quite hygienic for their era and bathed weekly.

## Medieval Period

In medieval England, animals could be put on trial for crimes. Pigs were particularly common defendants, often tried for injuring or killing children.

## World War I

The Christmas Truce of 1914 saw soldiers from opposing sides emerge from trenches to exchange gifts, sing carols, and even play football together before returning to combat.

## Ancient Greece

The word "idiot" comes from ancient Greek "idiotes," meaning a private citizen who didn't participate in public affairs. Not voting was considered shamefully self-centered.
